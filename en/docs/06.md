# 6.1.1. virtualenv

When using Python2, virtualenv is available for creating virtual environment.
The `virtualenv` module provides support for creating virtual environments with their own site directories, 
optionally isolated from system site directories. 
Each virtual environment has its own Python binaries (allowing creation of environments with various
Python versions) and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site directories.

Example) Creation of a virtual environment

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load python/2.7/2.7.15
[username@es1 ~]$ virtualenv hoo
New python executable in /fs3/home/username/work/bin/python2.7
Also creating executable in /fs3/home/username/work/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
```

Example) Activating a virtual environment

```
[username@es1 ~]$ source work/bin/activate
(work) [username@es1 ~]$
(hoo) [username@es1 ~]$ which python
/fs3/home/username/work/bin/python
(hoo) [username@es1 ~]$ which pip
/fs3/home/username/work/bin/pip
```

Example) Installing numpy to a virtual environment

```
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ pip install numpy
```

Example) Removing a virtual environment

```
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ deactivate
[username@es1 ~]$
```

# 6.1.2. venv

When using Python3, venv is available for creating virtual environment.
The `venv` module provides support for creating virtual environments with their own site directories, 
optionally isolated from system site directories. 
Each virtual environment has its own Python binaries (allowing creation of environments with various
Python versions) and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site directories.

Example) Creation of a virtual environment

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load python/3.6/3.6.5
[username@es1 ~]$ python3 -m venv work
```

Example) Activating a virtual environment

```
[username@es1 ~]$ source work/bin/activate
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ which python3
/fs3/home/username/work/bin/python3
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ which pip3
/fs3/home/username/work/bin/pip3
```

Example) Installing numpy to a virtual environment

```
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ pip3 install numpy
```

Example) Removing a virtual environment

```
(work) [username@es1 ~]$ deactivate
[username@es1 ~]$
```
